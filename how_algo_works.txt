### How Algo works ###

1, We're using dictionary to mimic the hash table data structure in order to record the total  number to sales per department.
2, Keys are departments, whereas their values are sequential sums of sales.
3, After creating the dictionary, we're creating a CSV.

### Computational complexity: Big O ###
For python dictionaries, which are based on a hash-table the worst case of finding an element is O(n) and average case is O(1)
